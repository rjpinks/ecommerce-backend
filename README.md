# To Do:
- Create DTOs for each of the models; perhaps, it is better to create them as I create the different layers of the application.
- Create seperate controllers and routes starting with product. Then I should move on and work some on the front end.

## Desires:
- Admin portal for easy access to the database. I'll probably have this as a seperate React app.
- Ability to create a CSV with all of the payment histories to make it easy for tax stuff.
